here are the optimal image sizes and resolutions for importing product images:

Optimal Import Specifications
For best results, import images at:

Resolution: 800×800px to 1200×1200px
Format: JPG or PNG (will be converted to WebP/AVIF)
Aspect Ratio: 1:1 (square) for consistency
Quality: High quality originals (will be compressed during conversion)
Compression Settings (from your optimization guide)
JPG: 80% quality
WebP: 80% quality
AVIF: 60% quality
Why These Sizes?
Your CSS uses object-fit: contain which prevents cropping, so images don't need to be exact dimensions. However, importing at 800×800px or 1200×1200px gives you:

Sharp display on retina/high-DPI screens
Room for zoom features (your images scale 1.05× on hover)
Good balance between quality and file size
Works well with the automated WebP/AVIF conversion
Avoid importing very large images (e.g., 4000×4000px) as they'll slow down your site unnecessarily.
